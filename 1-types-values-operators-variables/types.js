  // So first thing's first, let's talk comments. There are two ways to create a comment in Javascript.
  // This is a single-line comment. Whatever is written after two slashes will be ignored by the JS interpreter.
  // Single line comments can also follow code, as on line 1. 
  // You can also use mulit-line comments. Everthing in between /* and */ would be ignored by the interpreter.
  /*
    This is a mulit line comment! 
    Remember, you can nest single line comments within multi-line ones //like this
    But you can't nest multi-line comments within eachother or within single line comments!
