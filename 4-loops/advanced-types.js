/*
  In this section we are going to learn some more advanced data types.
  The first is called an array in javascript, it may have another name in other languages.

  DEFINITION

  So there are two ways to create an array. Try using them both in this section. 

  var a = new Array('list', 'of', 'values', 'as', 'arguments'); // This is called a constructor function. We'll look at functions tomorrow, and constructors next week.

  var b = ['list', 'of', 'vaules']; // This is called array literal syntax. 

  After using both methods discuss with your partner which method you prefer and why.
  Also, try logging the results to the console.
  Do you see any differences? *Hint* You shouldn't.
