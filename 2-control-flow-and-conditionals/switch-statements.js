  So did all of those nested if/else if/else statements get a bit hard to read? 
  Well there's another way to write long conditional statements to ease readability.

  Introducing, the switch statement.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch
  
  From MDN: "The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.

"

  Which means we also need to introduce the break statement.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break

  From MDN: "The break statement terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement."
