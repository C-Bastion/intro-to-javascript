  So did all of those nested if/else if/else statements get a bit hard to read? 
  Well there's another way to write long conditional statements to ease readability.

  Introducing, the switch statement.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch
  
  From MDN: "The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.

"

  Which means we also need to introduce the break statement.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break

  From MDN: "The break statement terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement."

  And I guess it's a good time to introduce my favorite, the return statement
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return

  From MDN: "The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller."

  We will get into loops and functions tomorrow, don't worry if you haven't seen them mentioned before.

  For now, just remember that the return statement does two things:
    1. It ends any conditional checking within that block
    2. It returns whatever value follows it (if nothing follows return, then undefined is returned)
